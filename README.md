# SOLID-principle

## Getting started with SOLID-principle using "C#"

This is an overview of what solid-principles are, and why a developer might want to use it.

## Installation or Setup

You can use any IDE (Visual studio or VSCode) and OOP language to implement S.O.L.I.D Principles. In the sample code I
have used C# as it is the most widely used language in .NET word and is closely.

## S.O.L.I.D Overview

As the process of writing software has evolved from the theoretical realm into a true engineering discipline, a number of principles have emerged. And when I say principle, I’m referring to a feature of the computer code that helps maintain the value of that code. Pattern refers to a common code scenario, whether good or bad.

For example, you might value computer code that works safely in a multi-threaded environment. You may value computer code that doesn’t crash when you modify code in another location. Indeed, you might value many helpful qualities in your computer code, but encounter the opposite on a daily basis.

There have been some fantastic software development principles captured under the SOLID acronym:
 **Single responsibility**, **Open for extension and closed for modification**, **Liskov substitution**, **Interface segregation**, and **Dependency injection**. You should have some familiarity with these principles.

## Single Responsibility Principle

There should never be more than one reason for change anything in software entities (class,function, file etc). A class, function, file etc should have only one reason to change.

## The Open Closed Principle
